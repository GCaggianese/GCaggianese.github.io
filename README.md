# 康青旭 — Personal Website

This site serves as a personal portfolio and my public second brain. You'll see:

- ✍️ **Posts** – Articles, writeups, and academic notes (currently in English).
- 🛠️ **Projects** – Real projects, research and personal work in AI, ML, Systems, Languages, and Cognition.
- 🧪 **Weekly Log** – Raw, unedited personal journals, published through Notesnook monographs.
- 🧵 **Drafts** – Early ideas and or unfinished content, also extra notes for projects.

For now, most content will be published in English with links to my **original source material in Spanish or Chinese** (or whichever language I wrote it in that moment).  
Multilingual support will be added soon via an LLM-powered translation layer powered by a custom Nim tool.

The content is organized following the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) beign my effort to build a meaningful and multilingual knowledge base.
